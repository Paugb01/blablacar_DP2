# ShortTripShare
### ShortTripShare is a platform developed by BlaBlaCar 🚙
#### Our aim is to be able to share short-distance rides within cities or between towns. This platform allows users to post their short trips from point A 📍 to point B 📍, and other users who need to travel from point A to a destination B' along the way can find and join these trips. The platform facilitates the entire process, from trip posting to transaction  completion.
